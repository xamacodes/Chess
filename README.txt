Project Summary

This project was a small recreational endeavor I pursued to pass time. It took me about 3 days to complete it,
and I did it entirely on my own. The chess game comes integrated with features that tell you if you move a piece
in the wrong direction, (i.e. a pawn can never move backwards, a knight can only moved in an L-shape, and the
king can only move one step at a time). Also, I programmed it such that a player cannot capture members
of their own "team".

In addition, I added a feature where when you hover over any box on the chess board, it lights up red. When you click
a box with a piece on it (intending to move it), the box that you select remains red until you
select a destination for the piece.

When one player captures another player's pieces, a notification appears on the right side of the screen,
recording the action (e.g. Player 1 captured Player 2's pawn!). I tried to make it as realistic as possible.
